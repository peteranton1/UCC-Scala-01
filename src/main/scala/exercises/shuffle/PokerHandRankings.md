# Poker hand rankings: ties and kickers

Poker is all about making the best five-card 
poker hand from the seven cards available (five 
community cards plus your own two hole cards). 
That means in the event of a tie with four of 
a kind, three of a kind, two pair, one pair, 
or high card, a side card, or 'kicker', comes 
into play to decide who wins the pot.
